Using this repo for very basic golang projects while I learn.

`helloWorld` - Self explanatory

`findian` - 	 Prints “Found!” if the entered string starts with the character ‘i’, ends with the character ‘n’, and contains the character ‘a’.  Otherwise prints "Not Found!".

`slice` - Prompts the user to enter integers and stores the integers in a sorted slice.  Exits when user enters 'X'.
